    "why_i_created_this_project": "After playing 70+ hours of Balatro I was perusing [r/Balatro](https://reddit.com/r/Balatro) and found that creating custom jokers was very popular among fans. After a litle bit of research I found there were no **easy-to-use** and **stylized** tools to make custom jokers. I also just really liked this game and wanted to code something related to it ([Balatro Calculator](https://efhiii.github.io/balatro-calculator/?h=IADaG0NobQoAChiDFnUzqZ1A) was a big inspiration for this).",
